# Remove_Duplication
Removing duplicates is important in data analysis and preprocessing. Duplicates can skew results and lead to inaccurate conclusions. By removing duplicates, you maintain data integrity and accuracy. 
The process involves loading the dataset, checking for duplicates, and eliminating them using appropriate methods. This ensures a clean dataset for reliable analysis. 
In Python, pandas is commonly used for this task. The duplicated() and drop_duplicates() methods in pandas are helpful for identifying and removing duplicates. Overall, removing duplication is crucial for ensuring the quality and accuracy of your dataset before further analysis or machine learning.
